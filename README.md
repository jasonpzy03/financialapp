# WealthWise Budget & Expense Tracker

WealthWise's Airost Project:
Budget & Expense Tracker

## Environment Set-up
We have built our project using Android Studio IDE, the mobile UI framework Flutter and the programming language dart. For the environment set-up, we are required to install Android Studio IDE from the official website. Next we need to install git if we haven’t already in our computers to allow us to do versioning, as well as installing the flutter sdk using git. The dart sdk can be installed by using the command “flutter doctor” in the flutter_console. Next, in Android Studio we need to install the flutter and dart plugins. Before we start our project, we do not have any prior knowledge of Flutter, Dart and mobile app development as a whole, so we needed to learn the basics from YouTube tutorials and official documentation. Please refer to the reference for the environment set-up YouTube video that we have watched and followed ourselves when we started.

## Installation
For the installation of our project, it can be done by saving our project folder to any preferred project folders. In our case, we have put it in Documents > Projects > Android Studio. Next, boot up Android Studio IDE and navigate to virtual device manager, here we recommend creating a Pixel 3a device with Android API 34 because it is the machine we used. After getting the virtual device ready, open the project folder in Android Studio.

## Execution / Running
In order to execute the project, first go to device manager and run the Pixel 3a device created. Then, we can run the “main.dart” file located in “FinancialApp\lib”. To build the project file into an APK, go to Build > Flutter > Build APK. The APK build will be located in “FinancialApp\build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk”. For the installation of our application, it can be done by simply installing the APK file that we have attached in this document, if unable to build the project file. Unfortunately, we did not have the time to do the IOS version, mainly because our development and tests were done on android devices for the whole developing phase. After installing the APK, the application can be launched from your android phone directly and the budget & expense tracker application will be ready to perform. In order to reset the database for testing purposes, make sure to navigate to More > “Reset Database”.
